For this project I found a map from the BLM which tracks wild horses and burros across the country. This map was designed to keep track of wild horse populations throughout the American West, show adoption and sale centers and total heard populations as a percent of appropriate management levels.
This map has three main interactive layers: head management areas, population of said herds, and adoption centers. These functions allow viewers to make the map more or less hectic. This map is targeted towards ranchers, recreators and environmentalists. This map was created by the BLM, Esri, HERE, Garmin, NGA, USGS and the NPS.

The data came in the form of Json files from the BLM. I could tell the data was vector data because the map has polygons drawn on it. I could not find a creation date but the BLM keeps them updated with current data. 

I found the design of this web map to be clear and easy to navigate. The layers were easy to find and apply to the basemap. You could also hide different menus to maximize the map screen.

This map incorperates a scale bar which adjusts with the zoom function. There is also a latitude and longitude function which can be turned on/off.
