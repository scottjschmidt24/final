For my final project I looked at the Natural Earth II with Shaded Relief and Water. The main objective of this map is to show the terrain above and below the oceans surface. This map is to serve as a base map for GIS applications.
I found this map to be targeted to a wide range of users given its simplicity. This map was freely available from the Natural Earth website, this open source map would allow more people to access it on a more casual occasion.
I could not find a creation date for this map but I was using the latest version which is 3.2.0.
Nathaniel Vaughn Kelso and Tom Patterson are this programs leads but they also receive lots of volunteer help from members of the NACIS (N. American Cartographic Information Society).
