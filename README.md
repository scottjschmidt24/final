For this project I found a map from the BLM which tracks wild horses and burros across the country. This map was designed to keep track of wild horse populations throughout the American West, show adoption and sale centers and total heard populations as a percent of appropriate management levels.
This map has three main interactive layers: head management areas, population of said herds, and adoption centers. These functions allow viewers to make the map more or less hectic. This map is targeted towards ranchers, recreators and environmentalists. This map was created by the BLM, Esri, HERE, Garmin, NGA, USGS and the NPS.

The majority of data came in the form of Json files from the BLM.  I could tell the data was vector data because the map has polygons drawn on it. I could not find a creation date but the BLM keeps them updated with current data.

I found the design of this web map to be clear and easy to navigate. The layers were easy to find and apply to the basemap. You could also hide different menus to maximize the map screen. This maps systemic achitecture consisted of a basic html file containing a head and body which made navigating the code simple.

The basemap used is a simple terrain map which contains roads, cities, state/country borders, lakes, forest etc. The main theme layer was the heard management areas which are found throughout Nevada and surrounding states. This layer also acted as an interactive feature because it could be turned on/off. Other interactive features for this map included the ability to drop a point via right clicking on the map, clicking on the heard area gives you information about the heard.

This map incorporates a scale bar which adjusts with the zoom function. There is also a latitude and longitude function which can be turned on/off. Responsive design is available for this map but it was significantly easier to navigate on the computer. There is also a function that helps accomodate the map to disabled persons. 

I found this map to be an effective form of displaying the given information. The website/ page was easy to navigate and the map was displayed front and center. The ability to toggle layers was nice to clean the map up. I would improve this map through adding more layers like wildlife refuges and wilderness boundries to help show untouched terrain.
